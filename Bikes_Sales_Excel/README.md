### This project was made in a excel file, so I can show off a little bit my habilites on excel software.

The project consists of making a dynamic dashboard to show different statistics and metrics on a **real dataset** with information about bike sales.

In order to do that I had to do some information preprocessing:
- Eliminate duplicates
- Make the data consistent
- Give the data some specific format
- Convert numerical values into categorical values
- Sort the data

Throught the process I used a few excel functions like **SUM()** and **IF()**. I also used tools from excel like:
- Conditional formating
- Data filtering
- Text to columns
- Pivot tables
- Charts
- Data types
- Slicers

Final result:
