# Data_Scientist_Portfolio
### Welcome to my Data Scientist portfolio!!!

My name is Adrian Vazquez, I'm a Data Scientist (sometimes a Data Analyst as well). In this portfolio I will be uploading my personal projects that I find interesting, and in the process, projects that also demonstrate my skill.

Although currently I have done many different projects, I am only going to upload the projects that I consider relevant, fun and interesting.

### Python Certificate
Here's my Python Cetificate from Udemy, although I've been coding in Python since 2017.
